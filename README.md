# ProfilePop
## Make your profile pop!

⚠ I might eventually make it so that you can get a GIF through this service itself, but I'm too lazy rn.

### Make the Hello, world! badge for your profile:

Go to https://savirsingh.github.io/ProfilePop/helloworld?YOURNAME

Then you can (externally) convert it to a GIF if you'd like.
