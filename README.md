# ProfilePop
## Make your profile pop!

âš  I might eventually make it so that you can get a GIF through the ProfilePop site, but I'm too lazy rn. You currently have to find your own way to make a GIF. Maybe someone could collaborate and do this with me? Idk

### Make the Hello, world! badge for your profile:

1. Go to https://savirsingh.github.io/ProfilePop/helloworld?YOURNAME

2. Then you can (externally) screen record the animated badge.

3. Then you can (externally) convert the video to a GIF.

4. Alternatively, you can copy the embed code and add your new badge to a website or something.
