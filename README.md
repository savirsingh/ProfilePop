# ProfilePop
## Make your profile pop!

âš  I might eventually make it so that you can get a GIF through the ProfilePop site, but I'm too lazy rn. You currently have to find your own way to make a GIF.

### Make the Hello, world! badge for your profile:

Go to https://savirsingh.github.io/ProfilePop/helloworld?YOURNAME

Then you can (externally) convert it to a GIF if you'd like.
